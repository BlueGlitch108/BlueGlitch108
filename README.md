## Hello, I'm Blue 👋  

I'm an aspiring software developer/pen tester based in South Africa!  

💻 I'm trying to develop my programming skills to be able to build whatever I want!  
🐍I'm currently learning C++ but i have dabbled in the likes of Python and Java previously.  
🌹My favourite tools are [VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com) and [Eclipse IDE](https://eclipseide.org)!  

🔭At the moment I'm trying to build up my github and find my way into the programming community!  

**Fun Facts:**
+ I absolutely adore animals, my house has been called a zoo!  
+ I've been interested in computers from quite a young age due to my father  
+ I love watching anime  
+ **Hobbies:** gym, eating, sleeping and gaming!
